									<h1>In the Light of Anguish</h1>
									<p>In the Light of Anguish was a collaborative project that united individuals from diverse backgrounds, including an artist, a musician, voice actors, and myself serving as the programmer and writer. As the team lead, I transformed the narrative and design into a functional game.
										<br><br>The gameplay of In the Light of Anguish revolves around exploration and uncovering hints. Players engage with the story by navigating environments and discovering clues left behind by Hunter's disappearance.
										<br><br>The story begins with the player searching for her lover. Everything is in disarray as she uncovers clues. In this narrative, the cruelty of humanity towards queer love is depicted, showcasing how anger directed at this phenomenon affects the lives of Dakota and Hunter. Their backstory becomes apparent as the game progresses, and upon reaching its conclusion, Dakota departs from the house, coming to the realization that Hunter has brought the world to ruins but couldn't shield herself, culminating in Dakota standing as the sole survivor. Overwhelmed by a spiral of panic, Dakota grapples with the attack, unable to accept the loss of the most precious element in her life. As the game restarts, Dakota's mind blocks out the truth as she embarks on a new search for Hunter.
										<br><br>The final result is thanks to everyone. Managing the team involved coordinating their efforts. Through regular meetings, feedback loops, and collaborative tools, we stayed aligned with the game's vision.</p>
