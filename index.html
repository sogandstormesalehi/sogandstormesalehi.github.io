									<h2><a >Harversted Souls</a></h2>
									<p>
									The rules of this land are cruel yet simple: If you're a cat, indulge in leisure, using everything for your heart's pleasure. Otherwise, run. The game begins through the eyes of Dante, a sweet and calm cat lounging in his favorite reading spot, far from the city's chaos. In his quest for favorite snacks, he stumbles upon an unexpected sight: a runaway slave, bleeding and barely breathing. Concerned for its well-being, Dante decides to return it to its owner. However, the human, Hunter, stops him, pleading for its life and attempting to flee. For the first time, a cat of this land listens to an inferior, unprepared for the chaos that kindness would introduce into his life, forever altering it.

As Dante nurses Hunter back to health, they forge a new goal more profound than Dante’s fun and peaceful life: to escape the confines of the land and pursue freedom, seeking a life that is kind to them both instead. Along the way, they encounter enemies who deem their path immoral, filthy, and naive, as well as victims who don’t want to be saved. 

Through desperation, horror, and hope, will they make it to the other side?

									<h2><a >Personalization</a></h2>
									<p>Artistic preferences are as diverse as the experiences and environments that shape us. Each person is unique, yet current generative models often struggle to reflect this diversity without extensive and detailed prompts. Consequently, their outputs tend to conform to a generic standard, disregarding minority perspectives due to the limitations of the data they are trained on.
										In our research, we introduce a method to extract individuals' preferences and personalize generative models accordingly. This enables the models to produce results that align with each user's unique taste in art when given the same prompt.
										<br>In the presented figure, we showcase the outcomes of a standard Stable Diffusion model (without personalization) alongside personalized results for four different users. Each row corresponds to the same initial prompt, while columns 2 to 5 display the preferences of individual users. It's notable how the concepts in the first column often favor a generic Western aesthetic. Conversely, the personalized results in subsequent columns maintain each user's unique preferences, encompassing various attributes such as vibe and art styles as extracted by our method.

										<h2><a >Deep Dream</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/deepdream.png"  /></a>
									<p>DeepDream is a computer vision algorithm using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify and enhance patterns in images. It operates by inducing controlled hallucinations within the CNN, making it exaggerate and emphasize detected patterns, resulting in surreal and distorted images. This technique is often used for artistic and creative purposes, revealing hidden details in images. Find my implementation of the algorithm in the github link below.</p>

										<h2><a >Diffusion Models</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/ddpm.png"  /></a>
									<p>Building diffusion models from scratch allowed me to delve into PyTorch, gain hands-on experience with contemporary computer vision research, and develop a robust understanding of stable diffusion. This significantly enhanced my proficiency in implementing the latest vision model techniques and related state-of-the-art papers. These models iteratively refine random initial samples with controlled noise, reducing noise intensity over time. They excel in generating high-quality data samples closely matching a target distribution, applied in tasks like image synthesis and text generation.</p>

										<h2><a >Style Transfer</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/styletransfer.png"  /></a>
									<p>Style transfer is a technique that merges the content of one image with the artistic style of another. Using neural networks, it creates captivating compositions, turning photos into artworks inspired by various styles, from famous artists to art movements. I wanted to get familiar with TensorFlow's models, and this one was pretty cool.</p>

										<h2><a >Transformers</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/transformer.png"  /></a>
									<p>Transformers are powerful machine learning models designed for sequential data tasks, especially in natural language processing. Unlike traditional sequence models, transformers process data in parallel, making them highly efficient. They leverage attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different elements in the input, enabling them to capture complex patterns and dependencies in data. Transformers have become the backbone of many state-of-the-art language models, enabling breakthroughs in tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering.</p>
