									<h2><a >Harversted Souls</a></h2>
									<p>
										In the shadowed realm of an askew reality, a chilling symphony of dominance unfurls. Let us enter the land through Dante's eyes: a soul accustomed to the twisted tapestry of existence woven by their species. The rules are simple. If you're a cat, enjoy your leisure by using everything for your heart's pleasure. Otherwise, run.

Routine blends with horror, and the wild dance goes on and on. But a chance encounter shatters Dante's apathy, as they meet Hunter. Hunter's eyes and soul carry tales of tragedy. The strands of their reality are about to be drawn into a disconcerting pattern. And so we embark on this adventure, seeking freedom. Let's rebel against injustice together.

									<h2><a >Visual Personalization</a></h2>
									<p>In the field of computer vision, particularly in image generation, the challenge of personalization is still very much a concern. Our main goal is to move away from traditional models and put the spotlight on catering to the visual preferences of each user. When you have a specific image in mind and want to create it using generative models, achieving your exact vision can be quite tricky. It often requires numerous iterations and feedback loops. Our objective is to simplify this process and reduce the burden on users.
										<br>
										Below is a sample result of our method: a user's personalized images compared to the general output of stable diffusion. Our blind tests show a 100% compatibility.

										<h2><a>Subtle Dread</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg"  /></a>
									<p>Embark on a mesmerizing journey into a realm where fear takes on a captivating form through the lens of playful eeriness. As you step into this world, your senses will be tantalized by a unique blend of unsettling charm and whimsical disquiet. This project dares to explore the uncharted territory where fear and creativity converge, inviting you to delve into the enigmatic depths of your emotions.</p>

									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/itloa.jpg"  /></a>
									<p>"In the Light of Anguish," a collaborative project, combined diverse talents to create a game focusing on exploring a narrative of queer love amid adversity. As lead, I shaped the game's design and narrative. Players uncover Dakota and Hunter's story while navigating disarrayed environments, highlighting the impact of societal cruelty. Our team's collective effort, facilitated through coordination and regular communication, brought the project to its impactful conclusion.</p>

									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/deepdream.png"  /></a>
									<p>DeepDream is a computer vision algorithm using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify and enhance patterns in images. It operates by inducing controlled hallucinations within the CNN, making it exaggerate and emphasize detected patterns, resulting in surreal and distorted images. This technique is often used for artistic and creative purposes, revealing hidden details in images. Find my implementation of the algorithm in the github link below.</p>

										<h2><a >Diffusion Models</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/ddpm.png"  /></a>
									<p>Building diffusion models from scratch allowed me to delve into PyTorch, gain hands-on experience with contemporary computer vision research, and develop a robust understanding of stable diffusion. This significantly enhanced my proficiency in implementing the latest vision model techniques and related state-of-the-art papers. These models iteratively refine random initial samples with controlled noise, reducing noise intensity over time. They excel in generating high-quality data samples closely matching a target distribution, applied in tasks like image synthesis and text generation.</p>

									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/styletransfer.png"  /></a>
									<p>Style transfer is a technique that merges the content of one image with the artistic style of another. Using neural networks, it creates captivating compositions, turning photos into artworks inspired by various styles, from famous artists to art movements. I wanted to get familiar with TensorFlow's models, and this one was pretty cool.</p>

									<a  class="image fit"><img src="images/transformer.png"  /></a>
									<p>Transformers are powerful machine learning models designed for sequential data tasks, especially in natural language processing. Unlike traditional sequence models, transformers process data in parallel, making them highly efficient. They leverage attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different elements in the input, enabling them to capture complex patterns and dependencies in data. Transformers have become the backbone of many state-of-the-art language models, enabling breakthroughs in tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering.</p>
